These libraries are developed by Eskil Steenberg under the Quel Solaar banner. All souce code is available under the Free BSD licence meaning that you are free to use ut anyway you want as long as you atribute its source.

The libraries here comprice a significant ammount of functionality that has been written to be easy to use, light weight, have few dependencies. Im releasing this software because i hope that it can help other developers to make games and other software. The code is divided into a number of libraries and you can include just the once you need in to your project.

## Forge

Basic defines for types and constants, Memory debugging, Vector and Matrix math, Sort, Colorspace conversion, random numberg generation and perlin noise, curves and animation.

## Imagine

## Betray

Extencive platform layer that lets you open windows, read input and connect to mics and spekers.

## Relinquish

A lightweight convinience wrapper arround OpenGL and OpenGL ES (Code written for Relinquish runs on both), with shaders, textures, vertex arrays and FBOs. Relinquish wraps many of newer fetures of OpenGL so that code will take advantage of them is they are available.

## Testify
